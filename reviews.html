			<p>Sigelei MT 220W</p>
			<p class="sig">At first sight this mod reminded me of a favorite superhero- Iron Man. Mainly due to the Red and Gold coloring, but it looks and feels like it is a solid metal construction, very durable. The fire button lights up red, with the option to turn it off, and there are 6 small LED lights around the screen that can be customized to any color. These also have the option of being turned off, or only on when using the mod. However, these lights all light up the same color, and they do not flash or shift through the color gradient. But they are adjustable with a Red-Green-Blue color input, and can be fine tuned. The mod also features a nice backlit screen that shows the atomizer resistance, individual battery life, Watt/Temp settings, puff counter, and a lock feature for the Watt/Temp setting. The only negatives to this device are that the menu options are slim (Only a menu for the color options and to switch between power and TC modes), some of the options require a combination of the fire and power adjustment buttons, and the user is unable to lock the fire button.</p>
